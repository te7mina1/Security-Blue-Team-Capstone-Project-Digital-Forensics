## Introduction

Digital  Forensics is a specialized field within the realm of forensic science that deals with the investigation, preservation, analysis, and presentation of digital evidence that will be used in an investigation. The primary goal is to establish the authenticity and integrity of the evidence, enabling it to be admissible in court, and ultimately, to assist in solving cyber crimes, intellectual property theft, fraud, and other digital-related offences. It is mostly found in Security Operations which is associated with monitoring business activities to maintain high-security posture, aiding with incident response to reveal details of how a compromise occurred and any post-actions, **DFIR or Digital Forensics and Incident Response).**

## Pre-requisites
- Operating System(Mac/Linux)
- Command-line experience
- A basic understanding of Digital Forensics and tools

## Lab Set-up and Tools

- A computer running an Operating System(e.g Mac/Linux)
- Digital Evidence
- strings, head, file, steghide

NOTE: It is highly recommended to perform your investigation from a dedicated, isolated environment (VMs) and also Note-Taking

## Conclusion

Practical hands-on Digital Forensics is very crusial in the field of Defensive Security. A successful completion of this course demonstrated in Defensive Digital Forensics. The skills gain, including **file carving, image analysis, password cracking**, are mostly applicable to **SOC roles and Threat Intelligence**.
